Problem 1

files: Problem1.java, Dijkstra.java, Vertex.java, Edge.java, BinaryHeap.java,
CityNotFoundException.java, citypairs.dat, cityxy.txt

compile Problem1.java and run using the citypairs and cityxy files as command-
line arguments: "java Problem1 citypairs.dat cityxy.txt" 
the GUI window will pop up with a drawing of all the cities arranged by their 
xy-coordinates. to find the shortest distance between two cities using the 
city pairs in the file, enter the source and destination city names into the 
text fields at the bottom and press to go button. the shortest path will 
display on the map, and the distance traveled is displayed at the top. 
to run multiple times using different cities, just replace the text in the 
boxes and press go. 



Problem 2 

files: Problem2.java, Kruskal.java, Vertex.java, Edge.java, BinaryHeap.java, 
DisjointSets.java, cityxy.txt

compile Problem2.java and run using the cityxy file as a command-line 
argument: "java Problem2 cityxy.txt" 
Kruskal's algorithm will run and the edges in the calculated minimum spanning 
tree will be outputted. A GUI window will also appear, which draws a map of 
all the cities and the MST edges.
